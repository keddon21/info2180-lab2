	 <article> <p> Today was a rough day not gonna lie. I had a lot to do and little time to do it. Usualy i get thing done from in the week but this time around I didn't have the resources to do these things during the week
	 </p> <p>By ressources im referring to internet access. Yes because of where I live and proverty, I struggle to do this online school thing, rough. </p> </article>

	 <article> <p> Comsci has a historry of failing student... is it the students? or is it comsci? I feel like it's comsci, not gonna lie, this is a taxing degree, and I'm hoping the work effort will match the level of comfort I will recieve from my job in the future.
	 But if that's not the case, UWI Mona will hear from my lawyers. </p> </article>
